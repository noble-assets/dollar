# `x/dollar`

This repository contains a native Cosmos SDK module that implements the Noble Dollar, \$USDN. The Noble Dollar is the first stablecoin leveraging M^0's canonical stablecoin building block, \$M, as its foundation. Its purpose is to serve as a dollar stablecoin that programmatically directs yield to the Cosmos ecosystem! Read the announcement article by [The Block][article].

## Architecture Overview

### Issuance of $USDN

Because the Noble Dollar is collateralized by \$M, issuance can only happen by locking \$M as collateral on Ethereum. This is done by utilizing M^0's Portal product, their custom cross-chain bridge powered by Wormhole's [Native Token Transfer][ntt] specification.

### Distribution of Yield

The module continuously keeps track of every $USDN holders principal on Noble, based on the latest rebasing multiplier from the M^0 protocol on Ethereum. This allows users to claim their yield on demand, whenever an updated multiplier is delivered from Ethereum.
